Object Oriented Multi Tape Turing Machine Implementation
============

This was a project for the Theory of Computation course in my junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). This is an object oriented multitape turing machine that can be configured to execute anything. 


## Tools and execution

The project was developed with Java as per the requirements. The main method contains an example on how to execute the method and test it. Two turing machines are configured and are ready to try. It will print out the intermediate states so that the computation history can be seen.
