Object Oriented CYK Algorithm Implementation
============

This was a project for the Theory of Computation course in my junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). Given a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and an input string, the algorithms outputs if the string belongs to the language of that grammar.

## Tools and execution

The project was developed with Java as per the requirements. The main method contains different examples on how to execute the method and test it. The input grammars are files like the ones that can be seen in the test directory and the string is passed as a parameter to the method.
