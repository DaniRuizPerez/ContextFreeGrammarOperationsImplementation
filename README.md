Theory Of Computation Algorithms implementation
============

This is a set of projects that I developed for the Theory of Computation course in the junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). 


## Projects:


- [ContextFreeGrammarOperations](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/TheoryOfComputationImplementations/tree/master/ContextFreeGrammarOperations): Collection of algorithms that, given a context free grammar (CFG), produces a second grammar equivalent to the first one that meets one of the following requirements:

- [CYK_Implementation](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/TheoryOfComputationImplementations/tree/master/CYK_Implementation): Given a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and an input string, the algorithms outputs if the string belongs to the language of that grammar.

- [TuringMachineImplementation](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/TheoryOfComputationImplementations/tree/master/TuringMachineImplementation): Object oriented multitape turing machine that can be configured to execute anything.

## Tools and execution

All the projects were developed in Java using Object Orientation, and can be easily imported in Eclipse.
