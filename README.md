Context Free Grammar Operations Implementation
============

This was a project for the Theory of Computation course in my junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). This is a collection of algorithms that, given a context free grammar (CFG), it produces a second grammar equivalent to the first one that meets one of the following requirements:

- Transform to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)
- every symbol is reachable
- every symbol is a generator symbol (if there is a production where all of right side symbols terminals)
- remove epsilon productions
- remove unitary productions
- all the previous criteria


## Tools and execution

The project was developed with Java as per the requirements. The main method contains an example on how to execute the method and test them. The input grammars are files like the ones that can be seen in the root directory.
