Theory Of Computation Algorithms implementation
============

This is a set of projects that I developed for the Theory of Computation course in the junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). 


## Projects:


- [ContextFreeGrammarOperations](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/ContextFreeGrammarOperations): Collection of algorithms that, given a context free grammar (CFG), produces a second grammar equivalent to the first one that meets one of the following requirements:



## Tools and execution

All the projects were developed in Java using Object Orientation.
